Chris Smith reports: "Top of the Championship and on course for back-to-back promotions, Southampton are looking to reach the quarter-finals for the first time since 2004 and only the second time in 14 years. Nigel Adkins' side have beaten the likes of Preston, Swindon and Torquay to get this far. Palace also are a team in form, after beating Ipswich at Portman Road at the weekend and the Eagles are up to fourth in Championship and have seen off the likes of Crawley, Wigan and Middlesbrough on the way in this competition. The last League Cup fixture between the two sides was in 1992 where Palace won 2-0."
